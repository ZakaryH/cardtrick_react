# Magic Card Trick App (React)

This is a React port of a card trick app I originally made using Angular 1.x based on my favorite real life card trick. This time around I wanted to ditch UnderscoreJS and do everything using ES6 and React's class-y Component syntax.

## About

Just a fun project for me to start learning React and to show off some of my abilities such as...

- Creating svgs
- Responsive design
- Programming patterns & logic
- OOP
- Design
- CSS animations
- Troubleshooting (there was a lot of it)
- Translating a concept between... frameworks in this case
- Building and deploying an app
